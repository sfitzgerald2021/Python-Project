# Python-Project
Overview
This project explores the Total Coloring Game, a graph theory problem where two players alternately assign colors to vertices and edges under rules that prevent conflicts (no two adjacent vertices, edges, or incident vertex–edge pairs can share the same color).

The Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive implementation of the game, where a human player competes against a computer opponent on path or cycle graphs. This project demonstrates both theoretical results from my senior comprehensive paper and practical simulations of gameplay.

View or Run the Notebook
  View on GitHub: Simply click on project.ipynb in this repository to see the code,         explanations, and graph visualizations.
  Run in Google Colab

Requirements
  Python 3.8+ 
  Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
  Libraries:
    pip install networkx matplotlib

How to Run Locally
  Clone or download this repository.
  Open project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
  Run the cells to play the game interactively and view graph visualizations.

Features
  Implements total coloring rules for path and cycle graphs.
  Interactive gameplay between a human and computer.
  Graph visualization using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
  Connects theoretical results from research with practical coding.

  The game then alternates turns between you and the computer. After each move, a graph visualization is displayed showing the updated coloring. The game ends when no valid moves remain and a winner is determined.

Sample Gameplay
Below are example screenshots of the game in progress (to be added after running the code):
  Step 0 - Initial uncolored graph

  Step 1 - First Move

  Step 2 - Second Move

  Step 3 - Third Move

  Step 4 - Fourth Move
  
  Step 5 - Final state showing winning position

Research Context
This project builds on my senior comprehensive paper, which develops and analyzes winning strategies for the Total Coloring Game across different graph structures (stars, cycles, paths). The program demonstrates these strategies in practice.
